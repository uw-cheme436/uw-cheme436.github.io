## Course Description

Lectures on statistics, experimental design, instrumentation, lab safety, and report writing; laboratory experiments on fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Emphasis on teaming, experimental planning, procedures, report writing, and oral presentations.

## Instructors

- Prof. Chad Curtis (ccurtis7@uw.edu)

## Teaching Assistants

- Le Zhen (zhenle@uw.edu)
- Chris Nyambura (cnyambr@uw.edu)

## Teaching Logistics

- Lectures: Tu/Th 12:30-1:20 (BNS 203)
- Labs:
    - (AA) M 1:30-5:20 (BNS 035)
    - (AB) T 1:30-5:20 (BNS 035)

## Course Objectives

1. To learn to deal with open-ended team assignments found in practice
2. To plan and carry out safe, efficient experiments involving typical chemical engineering concepts
3. To analyze and interpret experimental results using statistics
4. To make appropriate conclusions and recommendations
5. To write informative, persuasive technical reports
6. To present effective oral reports

## Expectations and Conduct

You are required to *be on time* and to act as a *professional engineer* in every assignment. You are expected to make full use of the laboratory session time and to work in teams cooperatively and effectively to fulfill all laboratory requirements on time.

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable by students as they pursue their academic goals. In particular, please review the definitions of academic misconduct found [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) and [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html#7). In the context of ChemE 436 lab, it is expected that all work in lab reports is the students' own work, including all data, analysis, and text. Students should not fabricate or falsify data contained in reports. Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by the College of Engineering.

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Lectures

We will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays for part of the quarter (first 6-7 weeks) to discuss statistical analysis, writing, experimental design, and ethics. At the end of the lecture series, you should be able to:

1. Assess the validity of the data you have gathered.
2. Assess the extent to which errors can be propagated through calculations.
3. Compare two datasets in a statistically meaningful fashion.
4. Extract the most important information from the raw data.
5. Optimize an experimental design to obtain the most data through the least amount of work.
6. Understand the consequences of unethical behavior.

## Laboratory

The class will be divided in teams of three students (teams of two when this isn't feasible). Each team will perform three experiments. For each experiment, one team member will serve as Task Leader to author the written **Planning Report**, another to author the **Final Report**, and the last one to present the **Oral Presentation**. These roles will be rotated such that each team member will submit one of each (planning, final, oral) during the quarter.

All data should be submitted as Excel spreadsheets including the source of each measurement, units, formulae for calculations, etc. Data should be sent to the TA at the end of the lab period. Final datasets should be submitted with the Final Report.

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to both me and the teaching team. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as early as possible so we can discuss your needs in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts) you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interaction process with you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with state and federal law.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/) available on this site.
